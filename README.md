# Github-Trending-API

...written in Python!

The motivation behind this API for me was to learn web scraping and how to create an API. It is based on the work of the real [github-trending-api](https://github.com/huchenme/github-trending-api) except that it's written in Python :wink:!

I used Python version 3.9 and:

- beautifulsoup4
- fastAPI
- uvicorn
